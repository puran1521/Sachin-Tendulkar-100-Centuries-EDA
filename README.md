# Data Science Project: Sachin Tendulkar - 100 Centuries EDA

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset containing the details of the 100 international centuries scored by Sachin Tendulkar, one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.

## Dataset Description

## Data Analysis

The project aims to answer some interesting questions about Sachin's centuries using various data analysis techniques and tools. Some of the questions are:

- How many centuries did Sachin score in each format (Test and ODI)?
- Which opposition team did Sachin score the most centuries against?
- Which batting position did Sachin score the most centuries from?
- Which venue and city did Sachin score the most centuries at?
- How many centuries did Sachin score as a captain and as a player of the match?
- What is the distribution of Sachin's scores and strike rates?
- How did Sachin's centuries affect the result of the match?

The project uses Python as the programming language and pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn as the libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The code and the output are presented in a Jupyter notebook file.
